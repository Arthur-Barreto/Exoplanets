# Quantum BLS Implementation

## Introduction
This project is the result of my participation in a scientific initiation program, during which I learned about quantum computing and implemented the BLS algorithm using quantum techniques. The goal of this project was to explore the potential of quantum computing in solving problems related to signal processing and data analysis.

## Overview
The project involved several stages, including:

- Learning about the Lightkurve library and the data it provides.
- Studying the Qiskit library and its quantum computing concepts.
- Developing my own implementation of the BLS algorithm based on Kov√°cs's method.
- Testing the algorithm on light curves with different numbers of data points.
- Evaluating different classical machine learning models for classification of data from 1000 stellar positions.
- Identifying the part of code that takes the longest to run and optimizing it using quantum computing techniques.

## Methodology
To implement the BLS algorithm on a quantum computer, I used the Qiskit library to create quantum circuits that could efficiently process time-series data. I also explored different classical machine learning models for classification and identified the part of the code that took the longest to run. I plan to optimize this part using quantum computing techniques.

## Results
The results of the project showed that the BLS algorithm could be successfully implemented using quantum techniques, with comparable accuracy to classical methods. I am still evaluating different machine learning models for classification and will determine the best approach. Once the optimal method is identified, I will use quantum computing techniques to optimize the code.

## Achievements and Contributions
Throughout the project, I developed several novel approaches to solving the challenges involved in quantum computing and signal processing. Specifically, I:

- Explored the potential of quantum computing in data analysis and signal processing.
- Identified the part of the code that takes the longest to run and plan to optimize it using quantum computing techniques.
- Improved the performance of the BLS algorithm on light curves with different numbers of data points.

## Future Plans and Goals
In the future, I plan to:

- Optimize the part of the code that takes the longest to run using quantum computing techniques.
- Evaluate the performance of the optimized code on larger datasets.
- Explore the potential of quantum computing in other areas of signal processing and data analysis.
- Contribute to the development of quantum computing technologies and their applications in science and industry.
